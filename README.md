I have created a native android studio application which allows uses to enter a recipe, store the data and rate.
I have made the application simple family friendly, that way it's easy to use and is safe for children use.
I made use of editText functions to allow users to be able to enter the recipe information.
The main activity has 4 editText functions, and 3 buttons (Add, Review and Exit buttons).
The add button will be used to store information, after the user has enterd the information he/she will press add and the information will be stored.
The review button take the user to the next activity (ReviewActivity). The review activity has to buttons (Next and Exit buttons)
The next button will allow the user to page through the recipes, and the exit buttons allow the users to exit the application.
Due to failure of my emulators i was not able to take screenshots.
